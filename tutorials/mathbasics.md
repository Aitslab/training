# Vectors
In the context of computer science vector can be thought of as a list of numbers. 
For example, a person can be described by their age (e.g. 40), weight (e.g. 70 kg) and height (e.g. 1.7 m). 

In python this could be written as:

vector = [40, 70, 1.7]

Or, if using numpy:

vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])
