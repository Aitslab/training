# Vectors
In the context of computer science vector can be thought of as a list of numbers. 
For example, a person can be described by their age (e.g. 40), weight (e.g. 70 kg) and height (e.g. 1.7 m). And in this could be written as a vector:
\[
\left( \begin{array}{c}
40 \\
70 \\
1.7
\end{array} \right)
\]
