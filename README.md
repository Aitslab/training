# Training resources
Training materials related to data science, artificial intelligence and bioinformatics. Resources which are not available for free are marked ($).
You can find links to organizations which provide physical courses (in physicalcourses.md) and links to data sources (in datasources.md). Distance courses by Swedish universities which require official registration are listed in SwedishUniDistanceCourses.md.


Here is a suggested learning path for getting started in data science. Resources are below:

1. Install Anaconda (or Miniconda), get familiar with conda environments and jupyter notebooks. Alternatively, if your own computer is limited, get familiar with Google colab.

2. Learn Python basics

3. Get familiar with the main functions of python tools needed for data processing and scientific computing: regular expressions, numpy, pandas

4. Get familiar with the basics of data visualization: matplotlib

5. Get a conceptual understanding of the core principles of machine learning and deep learning and hardware basics (GPU, CPU, memory)

6. Get a basic understanding of the main machine learning libraries: pytorch and keras/tensorflow

7. Learn how to evaluate machine learning models: metrics, confusion matrices, learning curves

7. Familiarize yourself with the concepts and tools of data science reproducibility: git, FAIR principles

8. Familiarize yourself with the main concepts and tools in your main area of interest, e.g. image analysis, nlp

9. Try solving specific tasks you are interested in, e.g. from your research project or daily life, using machine learning, and just continue learning the things that are required to solve these tasks.

10. Learn about more advanced topics that suit your interests: docker/singularity, continuous integration/unit testing/build automatization, parallel programming
